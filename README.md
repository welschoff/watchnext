# watchnext

An app to network with friends, share Watchlists and find the right series for you.

### Here you can view and test the app:

- [Heroku](https://app-watchnext.herokuapp.com/)
- Login with:
  ```
  username: Testuser
  password: 123456
  ```

## Installing / Getting started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`

2. In the project directory, you can then run:

**npm run build**: Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

`npm start`: Runs the server in production mode and serve production bundle from npm run build

The default ports are:

- `3000` for the server
- `3001` for the client
- `6006` for storybook

If you don't like to call all scripts at once, you can also run:

```
npm run dev-server
npm run dev-client
npm run dev-storybook
```

## Tests

A test runner is not installed (right now). But TypeScript, linter and prettier are checked on commit and push thanks to husky and lintstaged.
